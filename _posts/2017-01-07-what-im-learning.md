I've had this blog for a while. It started when I was doing front end development full time, but it's been a while since I've done that.

These days, I'm a product manager at Jibe, working on our Search and Apply products. One of the great things about product management and the technology field in general is that there is always something to learn. 

In fact, I'm going to focus this revived blog on everything I'm learning. I'll occasionally post about something I learned, but hopefully, I'll post more frequently about things I am learning. I don't want this to be pedantic space with proclamations on the right way to do things. More often than not, a universal "right way" doesn't exist. 

My goal will be one post a month as I get started. I hope that this effort keeps me engaged in continuous learning about product management, and for any readers I hope you keep learning as well!
