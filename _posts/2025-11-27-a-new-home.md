I'm bacK! After several dormant years, I'm working to bring back my blog as a home for writing on product management, development, and the impact of AI on all this. I got in to tech back in 2013-14 and I feel the same energy today as I did then with the capabilities of new AI models and tools. I'm looking forward to having a new medium to share my thoughts and experiences. Stay tuned!
